# Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring for a Containerized Flask Application

A minimal, production-style monitoring setup using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor a containerized **Python Flask application**.  
This project demonstrates core observability concepts such as metrics exposure, scraping, visualization, and containerized service communication.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements end-to-end monitoring for a sample Flask application using:
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for container orchestration

The application exposes custom metrics which are scraped by Prometheus and visualized through Grafana dashboards.
